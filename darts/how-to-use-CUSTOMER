To ensure all modit.store scripts load correctly, we can use the following method to assure the http request has responded before firing another.

in the config.lua file provided, add your script names to the `Mods` table.

E.G:
I purchased playerhousing, furni and territories.
I renamed the mods, respectively, housing, furnishing, ganglands.
I set the `Mods` table in the `config.lua` file as:
Mods = {
  'housing',
  'furnishing',
  'ganglands',
}

Add the following to your server.cfg:

add_ace resource.loader command.restart allow
add_ace resource.loader command.start   allow
add_ace resource.loader command.stop    allow
